/* This style sheet has styles that are applicable only to an element styled "clickSort".

Our CSS file naming convention (like the JS file naming convention) helps organize 
the CSS styles: "A component specific CSS file shall be
named for the component it styles. All styles within the style sheet shall be prefixed
by a single CSS class which is named the same as the CSS file." 

This "localizes CSS style rules" and allows us to "bundle" the styling of a component with the 
JavaScript code that creates the clickSort component. 

We (providers of the clickSort component) provide nice styling intitially, but the 
HTML coder has access to these styles and can change them however they want.
