                This assignment was not as difficult as I imagined it to be 
                before I started. The sample code combined with our last lab assignment,
                combined with the other two assignements we did using jsp, this assignment
                was relatively easy as I have a good understanding now of how to troubleshoot
                any problems I might run into with jsp.
                
                Along with jsp, I find react very
                useful and I like how it works a lot. Rather than having a bunch of different pages,
                just deleting the content of one page and replacing it when the user clicks a different
                tab on the site. 
            </p>
        </div>
    );
